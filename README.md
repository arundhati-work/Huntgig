# HUNTGIG - Job Portal

Huntgig is a job portal developed using React, Axios, and Material UI (optional), designed to offer job seekers an intuitive platform to explore job listings and company profiles. This project focuses on front-end development with session management and dynamic content rendering, providing a user-friendly experience.

This assignment has been created by Arundhati Bandopadhyaya (NUID: 002313855) as part of assignment 9 for INFO6150 course taught by Prof. Vishal Chawla.

## Features

1. **Login and Session Management**:
- A login page authenticates users using stored usernames and passwords.
- User sessions are managed using Axios for API calls, with options to login and logout.
- User information is verified against data manually entered into the backend, following secure session protocols.

2. **Job Portal Pages and Routing**:

    There are 7 pages for easy navigation:
- Home: Introduction to Huntgig.
- About: Overview of Huntgigâ€™s mission, values, and key features.
- Job Listings: Dynamic job listings showcasing available positions.
- Company Showcase: Image gallery of companies with basic details.
- Contact: Contact form for users to reach out, including FAQs in an accordion.
- Sign up: To create user account with email, password and confirm password.
- Login: To log into user account with email and password.

3. **Job Listings with Frontend Data**:
- The Job Listings page dynamically displays job positions using front-end data, with each listing providing job title, last updated, description and link to apply.
- The data for job listings is handled on the front end for efficient rendering without API requests.

4. **Company Showcase with Image Gallery**:
- Company Showcase page displays a gallery of company images sourced from the backend.
- Images are retrieved without requiring specific user-based filtering for now, focusing on gallery display.

5. **Material UI Components**:
- Material UI components enhance design and responsiveness throughout the portal.
- Features include navigation bars, buttons, cards, accordions and form elements for a cohesive and professional look.
